An embedded system is a combination of computer hardware and software designed for a specific function. Embedded systems may also function within a larger system. The systems can be programmable or have a fixed functionality.
 For example, a fire alarm is a common example of an embedded system which can sense only smoke.

>#### An embedded system is a combination of three major components:
>
>Hardware: Hardware is physically used component that is physically connected with an embedded system. It comprises of microcontroller based integrated circuit, power supply, LCD display etc.
>
>Application software: Application software allows the user to perform varieties of application to be run on an embedded system by changing the code installed in an embedded system.
>
>Real Time Operating system (RTOS): RTOS supervises the way an embedded system work. It act as an interface between hardware and application software which supervises the application software and provide mechanism to let the processor run on the basis of scheduling for controlling the effect of latencies.

## Types of Embedded System
Embedded Systems are classified based on the two factors i.e.

>1. Performance and Functional Requirements
>2. Performance of Micro-controllers
### Based on Performance and Functional Requirements it is divided into 4 types as follows :
#### 1.Real-Time Embedded Systems 
A Real-Time Embedded System is strictly time specific which means these embedded systems provides output in a particular/defined time interval.
> Further this Real-Time Embedded System is divided into two types i.e.

>##### Soft Real Time Embedded Systems –
> In these types of embedded systems time/deadline is not so strictly followed. 
>##### Hard Real-Time Embedded Systems –
>In these types of embedded systems time/deadline of task is strictly followed.

>Examples :
>Traffic control system
>Military usage in defense sector
>Medical usage in health sector

#### Stand Alone Embedded Systems :
Stand Alone Embedded Systems are independent systems which can work by themselves they don’t depend on a host system. It takes input in digital or analog form and provides the output.

Examples :
1. MP3 players
2. Microwave ovens
3. calculator

#### Networked Embedded Systems :
Networked Embedded Systems are connected to a network which may be wired or wireless to provide output to the attached device. 

Examples :
1. Home security systems
2. ATM machine
#### Mobile Embedded Systems :
Mobile embedded systems are small and easy to use and requires less resources.

Examples :
1.MP3 player
2.Mobile phones
3.Digital Camera
### Based on Performance and micro-controller it is divided into 3 types as follows :

#### 1. Small Scale Embedded Systems :
#### 2.Medium Scale Embedded Systems :
#### 3.Sophisticated or Complex Embedded Systems :

## Design metric of embedded system
A design metric is a way to objectively evaluate a design. 
1. Market Need/Requirment
2. cost
3. size
4. Efficeincy
5. performance |---Throughput
               |---Latency
6. Energy Consumption
7. Energy cost
8. Manufacturing Cost
## RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer):
In the RISC architecture, the instruction set of the computer system is simplified to reduce the execution time. RISC architecture has a small set of instructions that generally includes register-to-register operations.

* A RISC processor has a few instructions.
* RISC processor has a few addressing modes.
* Memory requirement is more.
* In the RISC processor, all operations are performed within the registers of the CPU.
* RISC processor can be of fixed-length.
* RISC can be hardwired rather than micro-programmed control.
* RISC is used for single-cycle instruction execution.
* Less Hardware is required in terms of decode instruction.
## CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer):
The CISC architecture comprises a complex instruction set. A CISC processor has a variable-length instruction format.
* More Instruction
* More Addressing Modes.
* More Hardware is required in terms of decode instruction.
* Memory requirement is less.
