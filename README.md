An embedded system is a combination of computer hardware and software designed for a specific function. Embedded systems may also function within a larger system. The systems can be programmable or have a fixed functionality.
 For example, a fire alarm is a common example of an embedded system which can sense only smoke.

>#### An embedded system is a combination of three major components:
>
>Hardware: Hardware is physically used component that is physically connected with an embedded system. It comprises of microcontroller based integrated circuit, power supply, LCD display etc.
>
>Application software: Application software allows the user to perform varieties of application to be run on an embedded system by changing the code installed in an embedded system.
>
>Real Time Operating system (RTOS): RTOS supervises the way an embedded system work. It act as an interface between hardware and application software which supervises the application software and provide mechanism to let the processor run on the basis of scheduling for controlling the effect of latencies.

## Characteristics of an Embedded System

## Types of Embedded System
Embedded Systems are classified based on the two factors i.e.

>1. Performance and Functional Requirements
>2. Performance of Micro-controllers
### Based on Performance and Functional Requirements it is divided into 4 types as follows :
#### 1.Real-Time Embedded Systems 
A Real-Time Embedded System is strictly time specific which means these embedded systems provides output in a particular/defined time interval.
> Further this Real-Time Embedded System is divided into two types i.e.

>##### Soft Real Time Embedded Systems –
> In these types of embedded systems time/deadline is not so strictly followed. 
>##### Hard Real-Time Embedded Systems –
>In these types of embedded systems time/deadline of task is strictly followed.

>Examples :
>Traffic control system
>Military usage in defense sector
>Medical usage in health sector

#### Stand Alone Embedded Systems :
Stand Alone Embedded Systems are independent systems which can work by themselves they don’t depend on a host system. It takes input in digital or analog form and provides the output.
>Examples :
>
>MP3 players
>Microwave ovens
>calculator
